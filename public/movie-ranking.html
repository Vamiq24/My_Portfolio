<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>The College life is a phase in one's life which results not only a sheet of paper but the endless memories. This movie shows that phase in a very beautiful way with a strong message of "Let the child follow his/her passion and ambitions."</p>
<h3>Chennai Express</h3>
<p>It is the movie that every SRK fan admire off. It is one of the best comedy movie of Bollywood so far. The story revolves around a character who accidentally board the wrong train and reached a place which is totally different in culture and everything as that of his place. The Climax ends up with a social message of giving respect and importance to our daughters and consider thier lives equal to that of a son(giving them the right to chose for themselves the way of life they wanted to lead)</p>
<h3>Dangal</h3>
<p>Yet again an inspirational and one of the most successful Bollywood movies of all time is Dangal. It is a biopic of one of the best female wrestler of the country. The movie shows the struggle a girl from a stereotypic society has to face. The story revolves around the struggles and hard-work that she did with the guidance of his father who wanted to be a wrestler but was unable to pursue his dream due to family responsibilities.</p>
